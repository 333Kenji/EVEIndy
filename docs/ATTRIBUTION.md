This project uses subsets derived from the EVE Online Static Data Export (SDE).

- EVE Online and all related logos and images are trademarks or registered trademarks of CCP hf.
- The SDE is provided by CCP for third-party development. See CCP's developer site for terms.
- We fetch and parse SDE YAML files (typeIDs, industryBlueprints) and store a reduced subset (type_ids, blueprints, structures) in our database for internal calculations.

If requested by CCP, we will remove or adjust redistributed subsets accordingly.
